ML project using Decision Tree, KNN, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes to classify tumors
# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project uses supervised learning algorithms â€” Decision Tree, KNN, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes â€” to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with model code and evaluations.
- `breast_cancer_report.pdf`: Final report explaining algorithms, performance, and conclusions.
- Confusion matrix images (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes

## âœ… Project Objective
To support early diagnosis of breast cancer using machine learning techniques by analyzing key features from tissue samples.

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance
All models performed well with over 90% accuracy. KNN had the best balance of precision and recall.

## ðŸ§  Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble models like Random Forest
- Real-time deployment with a Flask web app
